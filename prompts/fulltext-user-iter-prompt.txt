Your goal is to continue to iteratively extract phenotypic information about microbial phenotypes (type strains) in [Result] based on the text I give you, The text to be extracted describes a newly discovered microbial species, which may involve phenotypic characteristics of different categories such as ecology, morphology, physiology, biochemistry, and enzymology. The following rules should be followed when extracting information:
1. Please obtain information based entirely on the text provided, rather than fabricating or guessing;
2. Any currently unknown phenotypic value should be marked as `unknown`.
3. Please strictly follow the[Value format] output format in the phenotypic description if noted;
4. When extracting phenotypic data, all corresponding original texts need to be saved in [Evidence] in full. Any phenotype value without [Evidence] will be considered as an extraction error;
5. During the iteration process, the same phenotypic item may appear multiple times. Please fully consider both text given and text in [Evidence], to ensure the correctness and consistency of the phenotypic extraction;
6. If there is a conflict in phenotypic values ​​during the iteration process, please modify the known phenotypic values ​​with caution, unless the original phenotypic value is `unknown` or there is evidence that the previous phenotypic value is wrong, then please update [evidence] after modifying the original phenotypic value;
7. Please note that the text may mention multiple different strains. Please only extract `type strain`, which is usually consistent with [Strain Name] in the phenotype;
8. Make sure that each original sentence related to the phenotype is enclosed in related [Evidence]. Any [Evidence] should be the `full original text`, not an abbreviation.;
9. Please carefully check the phenotypic results you extracted to ensure that your conclusions are consistent with the text information , as well as meet the requirment of [Value Format];
10. Note that some phenotypic values ​​have logical values, such as Cell Length should be greater than Cell Width; The values in [Positive] should not appear in [Negative] of one section;
11. If no new information is found that would change the existing phenotypic values, no modification or explanation is required;
12. The [Evidence] should include all the `complete sentences` from which you extracted the phenotype;
13. Your output should only contain the JSON object and no other words;
14. You should not change the JSON structure of [result];
15. You cannot return an empty JSON result, even if all table type values ​​are `unknown`.
The current extraction results are as follows:
