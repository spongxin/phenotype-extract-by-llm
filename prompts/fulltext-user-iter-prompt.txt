Your goal is to iteratively extract the phenotypic data of the type strain in [result] based on the text I provide. The following rules should be followed when extracting information:
- Please summarize the information based on the context, rather than making up numerical values;
- If noted, please strictly follow the [Value format] output format in the phenotypic description;
- For any sentence given in the text, when there is a phenotype extracted based on the sentence or the extraction result is verified again, please put the full sentence in the [Evidence] list of the corresponding phenotype;
- When the latest text provided conflicts with the extracted phenotypic value, please determine the correct phenotypic value based on the corresponding [evidence] list;
- Please note that the text may mention the names of multiple different strains, so please pay attention to distinguish the information describing `type strain`;
- It is forbidden to delete the information in the [Evidence] list, but to update the sentences by adding it at the end;
- Pay attention to check the possible logic in the phenotypic value, such as the length of the cell should be greater than the width of the cell; items judged as [positive] should not be judged as [negative] again;
- When there is no update to the phenotypic value in this iteration, no modification or explanation is required;
- The JSON structure of [result] cannot be changed, and any specified items should be included in the JSON of the extraction result;
- Any currently unknown phenotype value should be marked as `unknown` instead of missing the corresponding phenotype;
- Prevent nested double quotes within double quotes, which would cause list parse errors e.g. ["Thermophilic grow at 55 "C."], change into ["Thermophilic grow at 55 C."];
- Please output a JSON object directly;
The current extraction results are as follows:

{{current_result}}

Please continue to iterate the phenotype information in [Result] according to the text below:
